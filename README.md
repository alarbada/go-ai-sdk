# go-ai-sdk

An unofficial port of the vercel ai toolkit, in go. As complete as the https://github.com/sashabaranov/go-openai package is, using agents with it is very painful. The abstraction vercel has made is very convenient, so I feel this was missing in the go ecosystem.

## Status

Very alpha, this is at the moment a proof of concept. APIs will change.

## TODO

- [ ] [generateText](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/ai-sdk-core/generating-text)

  - [x] Basic implementation with similar API
  - [ ] Add more parameters

- [ ] [streamText](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/ai-sdk-core/generating-text#streamtext)

  - [ ] Basic implementation with similar API
  - [ ] Adjust parameters
